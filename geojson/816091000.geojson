  "description": "The \"Altar of Augustan Peace\" was located in the Campus Martius of Rome. It was originally situated to the west of the Via Lata, near the eastern end of Augustus' Horologium. The reconstructed fragments of the altar are now housed in a museum located on the Tiber's banks in the Piazza Augusto Imperatore, a square created during the Fascist era in order to spotlight the ruins of the Mausoleum of Augustus.",
