  "description": "Ward-Perkins identified the archaeological site at Fosso della Crescenza during the South Etruria Survey. Excavations of a Iulio-Claudian mausoleum were undertaken in 1962. Additional excavation revealed portions of the Via Veientana. Post-excavation work did not occur until the 1980s, by which time Fentress 1983 notes that the the archaeological landscape had been largely eradicated by the burgeoning growth of suburban Rome.",
