  "description": "Ekalte, modern Tall Munbāqa, is a medium-sized Bronze Age settlement on the left bank of the Euphrates in northern Syria, ca. 85 kilometres east of Aleppo. Inhabited as early as 2,000 BCE, Ekalte grew to become a significant urban centre in the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600-1200 BCE).  Excavations by the German Oriental Institute since 1969 have unearthed extensive tracts of the urban landscape. Today, the site is partially submerged beneath the waters of the Lake Assad.",
