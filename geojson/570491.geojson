  "description": "Mycenae was an ancient settlement of the Argolid, with the earliest occupation evident ca. 2900 B.C. As the eponymous site of the Mycenaean culture of the Aegean Bronze Age, the site flourished as a fortified citadel during the mid to late second millennium B.C. In the first millennium B.C., the site experienced a revival of fortunes, although by Strabo's time the settlement had vanished.",
